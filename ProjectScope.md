# Scope
Devious.work is my root domain and I feel it needs a makeover.

At the moment, it's a cool techy site with some websites an a couple secrets, cool features, and animations.

I would like to make this root domain more about me and the domain as a whole, as opposed to its minimal features at the moment.

## Propposed site
I'd like devious work to have the following:
- Highly Professional Tech theme
- Smooth, high-quality animations
- Professional Portfolio section which allows easy editing (in the files, not on the site) - leave this with a "Coming soon, gang" to start with. Ideally make the portfolio Markdown compatible
- No emojis
- Easter eggs and hidden features
- Dynamic site searcher which finds all sites under my root domain
- Keep the guestlog / message book - Feel free to rewrite it, but keep it overall
- Push to https://github.com/daolyap/devious.work and have the worker update from the git repo
- Keep the github link / social
- Give the site useful features for both myself and users of it too
